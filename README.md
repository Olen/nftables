This tool a simple way to display information from nf-tables in a more iptables-like format.

It complements the official `nft` tool, and tries to find a space between `nft` - where the output can be quite complex to follow, and `iptables-nft` - which I felt was to limited.

The tool is not designed to modify nf-tables rules, only to display them in an easy to understand format.

You can chose to display the entire ruleset, or just a single `hook` (input, output, forward, prerouting, postrouting), a single chain, or a set.

## Examples

### Display a single hook

nftables -L input
```
hook      # chains
------  ----------
input            3

chain      table        priority  default
---------  ---------  ----------  ---------
MYCHAIN    filter            -10  accept
f2b-chain  f2b-table          -1  accept
INPUT      filter              0  accept

handle         pkts    bytes  target    log    proto    filter
-----------  ------  -------  --------  -----  -------  --------------------------------------------------

```

If your terminal supports color, the output is even easier to read:

The output is ordered according to the chain priority, and you can easily get a good overview over what chains and rules are in use and how they are configured.

### Display a set

nftables -s my-set
```
add set inet filter my-set { type ipv4_addr; size 65536; }
flush set inet filter my-set
add element inet filter my-set { 10.20.0.0/16 comment "network 1" }
add element inet filter my-set { 10.40.0.0/16 comment "another network" }
add element inet filter my-set { 172.16.0.0/16 comment "lan" }
```

Output here is actually the format to recreate the set, so you can easily run this command and redirect to a file (`nftables -s my-set > my-set.nft`, add or modify entries, and just run `nft -f my-set.nft` to update it.

After searching and discovering [nftwatch](https://github.com/flyingrhinonz/nftwatch) I was inspired to create something even simpler and more familiar when you come from an iptables-background, without all the limits of `iptables-nft`
